## CountDown_Timer
A simple Python countdown timer that counts down from a user defined number with a 1 second delay.

This is a simple Countdown Timer built using Python.
The program asks the user to enter a number and then starts counting down step by step, waiting one second between each number. When the countdown finishes, it displays a friendly message.
This project is great for beginners who want to practice loops, user input, and working with time in Python.

##### 🧠 How It Works

- The user enters a number to start the countdown.
- The program counts down to 1.
- A 1-second delay is added between each count.
- A final message is displayed when the countdown ends.
